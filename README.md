# OBSTACLE-AVOIDING-ROBOTIC-CAR
The obstacle avoiding robotic vehicle uses ultrasonic sensors for
its movements. A microcontroller is used to achieve the desired
operation. The motors are connected through the motor driver IC
to the microcontroller. The ultrasonic sensor is attached in front
of the robot. Whenever the robot is going on the desired path the
ultrasonic sensor transmits the ultrasonic waves continuously
from its sensor head. Whenever an obstacle comes ahead of it the
ultrasonic waves are reflected from an object and that information
is passed to the microcontroller. The microcontroller controls the
motors to move the car left, right, back or front based on the
ultrasonic signals.
